# ShoppingInterface
This was an end-of-year project I created in the 9th grade for AP CSA and AP CSP, simulating a shopping cart interface used in websites such as Amazon and eBay.

# Description
Because this was a freshman year project, the GUI is fairly simple, and the search algorithms are unoptimized, but nonetheless functional.
The project is split into 2 main sections: accounts, items.
The account section deals with account creation, password resetting, and logging in and out of the program using these accounts.
The item section deals with item creation, reviewing items, purchasing items, and searching for items.
All the data for both accounts and items are stored locally on the computer, since I did not know how to connect this to a server my freshman year.
All data is updated in real time when interacted with.

# Installation
Using Eclipse Pro, create a new Java project.
Download the GitHub repository
Replace the empty project src folder with the downloaded GitHub repository.

# Use
Run using the file Teqnifiii.java
I unofficially named the application Teqnifiii, so that's why the main file is called Teqnifiii.java
